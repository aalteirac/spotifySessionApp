# spotifySessionApp
Qlik Session App sample, based on Spotify information. App is created dynamically and only in RAM.

To see data you'll need to have at least one public playlist on your Spotify account. Analyse only the 20 first playlists because of Spotify API rate limit, just a sample :-)

Requires a Sense Enterprise Server >=3.2, virtual proxy minimal settings provided in the code (config.js)

Nodejs and npm install needed

Thanks to Jos√©.F and Ann-Louise.A for original idea and implementation ! WTK rocks !
